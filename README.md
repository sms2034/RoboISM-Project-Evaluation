# RoboISM-Project-Evaluation
I have wrote the codes (with simulation) on wokwi, the text file contains the wokwi links to the same.
I have also wrote code for IR sensor(without simulation) in the ino file.
I have tried variation with ultrasonic sensor where the led is turned on if the object in front of the sensor is at a distance less than 50cm.
I have made servo to rotate 0 to 180 degree depending on the potentiometer value.
